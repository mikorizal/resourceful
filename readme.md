#Resourceful

##Who
[@donlewi](https://github.com/donlewi)

##What
Resourceful is a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) app to assist in the management of and planning for collections (stamps, cars, hot-sources...). It implements the [resource](https://github.com/valueflows/resource) part of [valueflows](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows), a network implementation of [Resource-Event-Agent Economic Model](https://www.msu.edu/~mccarth4/). It is both an exercise in implementation of the system and a step towards creating a more complex app that allows for the [exchange](https://github.com/valueflows/exchange) and [processing](https://github.com/valueflows/process) of resources.

##Where
Crafted in New Zealand of course!

##How
Development will use a [Domain Driven Design](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=97) approach. The bread and butter of this will be [Ghurkin Specs](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), these will be parsed into tests that will be coded against in implementation.

High level development roadmap:

 - [x] [Whiteboard jam on schema](./jams/wb-jam-01.JPG)  
 - [ ] [Gherkin Features and Scenarios](./features)  
 - [ ] Implement Gherkin features in app  
 - [ ] Implement responsive web User Interface  

##Why
Because everyone collects something and a tool to help manage their collections will save them time. Because we want to test ValueFlows through implementation. Because it is a step forward...
