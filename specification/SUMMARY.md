**Resourceful Specification**

The specifications are formatted in the [Gherkin3](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin3) syntax and the folder structure has been setup to be read by [featurebook](https://github.com/SOFTWARE-CLINIC/featurebook), though you could just view them in a text editor like sublime.

The specifications detail the intent of the resourceful app, when finished they should define the entirety of what will be built for the first release.
